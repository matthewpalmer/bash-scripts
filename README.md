Small collection of scripts I use
##FEATURES:
Add and commit to remote git repository in a single line in `gitremote.sh`
`lessReload.sh` automatically build and compile a less file to css every second. The files have to be 'styles.less' and 'styles.css' -- this is easily changed

####USAGE:
Use http://nixcraft.com/shell-scripting/13025-how-execute-shell-script-any-where.html once you've got all the shell scripts to the ~/bin/ dir.
Using `script.sh` didn't work for me - use `bash script.sh`
